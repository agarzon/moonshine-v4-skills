# MoonShine v4 — Skill Router

MoonShine v4 is a Laravel admin panel framework (PHP 8.2+, Laravel 10.48+) for building back-office applications. It provides:

- **ModelResource** — CRUD scaffolding with page-centric architecture (IndexPage, FormPage, DetailPage)

- **Components** — FormBuilder, TableBuilder, 70+ layout/display/overlay components
- **Layouts & Theming** — Menu system, palette-based colors, icons, dark mode, custom assets
- **Frontend** — API mode with JWT, SDUI, OpenAPI generator, Alpine.js integration, AsyncCallback
- **Security** — Authentication, authorization, policies, 2FA, Socialite, custom auth responses

## How to Use This Skill

Based on what the task involves, read **1–3 relevant sub-skills** from the table below. Each sub-skill is a self-contained `SKILL.md` with code examples and references to deeper documentation.

## Instructions

1. **Identify** which areas the task touches (usually 1–3 from the table above)
2. **Read** the corresponding `SKILL.md` file(s) using the Read tool — resolve paths relative to this file's directory
3. **Follow** the patterns and examples in those sub-skills
4. If deeper detail is needed, each sub-skill cross-references files in its `references/` folder

## Quick Reference: Common Task Mappings

**"Create a new resource"** → setup + resources + fields

**"Add a custom page"** → resources + components

**"Build a dashboard"** → components + appearance + advanced (recipes)

**"Set up auth/permissions"** → security + setup

**"Add API endpoints"** → frontend + resources

**"Customize the theme"** → appearance

**"Add a custom field"** → fields + components

**"Write tests"** → advanced

**"Migrate from v3"** → setup (migration section)
